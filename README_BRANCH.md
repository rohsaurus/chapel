# Dissertation Experiments

This branch is a fork/clone of Chapel version 1.28. Specifically commit `21eac0`.

We will manually add in the optimizations performed in the other branches of this fork
and use this branch as our test bed for all experiments that will be included in my
dissertation. This ensures we are not introducing any feature breaking commits from 
the main Chapel repository (i.e., we are on a stable branch).

We will make minor changes to our optimizations as we go along to fix any bugs we find
or implement improvements. But the intention is that we will never merge in changes from
Chapel itself.
