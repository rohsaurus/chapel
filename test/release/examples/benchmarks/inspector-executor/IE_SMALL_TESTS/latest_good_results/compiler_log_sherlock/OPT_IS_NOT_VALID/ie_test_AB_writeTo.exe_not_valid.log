+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Pre-Folding Analyzing candidate at ie_test_AB_writeTo.chpl:24: parent -> A, call -> B, access type -> INSPECTOR
	- A and B are arrays
	- A supports the localSubdomain() query
	- forall is iterating over a distributed domain/array
	- index iterator B is an array or domain
	- loop iterator B is an array or domain
	- A's element type is POD
	- forall is nested in an outer serial loop
	- $$$ Optimization VALID at Pre-Folding; replacing primitive with inspectAccess()
