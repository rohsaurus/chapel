+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Pre-Folding Analyzing candidate at ie_test_invalidStoreAsRef.chpl:25: parent -> A, call -> B, access type -> INSPECTOR
	- A and B are arrays
	- A supports the localSubdomain() query
	- forall is iterating over a distributed domain/array
	- index iterator B is an array or domain
	- loop iterator B is an array or domain
	- A's element type is POD
	- forall is nested in an outer serial loop
	- A doesn't store records and candidate access is stored as a non-ref variable
