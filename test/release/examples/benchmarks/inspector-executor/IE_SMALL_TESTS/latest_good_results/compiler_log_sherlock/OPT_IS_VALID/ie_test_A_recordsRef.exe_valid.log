+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Considering candidate irregular access at ie_test_A_recordsRef.chpl:52 (forall at ie_test_A_recordsRef.chpl:50)
	- Parent: A, Call: B
		- Candidate access is in a for-loop (ie_test_A_recordsRef.chpl:51) that is nested in the forall
		- index iterator B is defined outside of the loop
		- Candidate is valid thus far
+ [ADAPTIVE REMOTE PREFETCH] Considering candidate irregular access at ie_test_A_recordsRef.chpl:52 (forall at ie_test_A_recordsRef.chpl:50)
	- Parent: A, Call: B
		- Candidate access is in a for-loop (ie_test_A_recordsRef.chpl:51) that is nested in the forall
		- enclosing loop(s) have valid structure

+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Pre-Folding Analyzing candidate at ie_test_A_recordsRef.chpl:50: parent -> A, call -> B, access type -> INSPECTOR
	- A and B are arrays
	- A supports the localSubdomain() query
	- forall is iterating over a distributed domain/array
	- index iterator B is an array or domain
	- loop iterator B is an array or domain
	- A's element type is record
	- Record elements from A only access POD fields
	- forall is nested in an outer serial loop
	- $$$ Optimization VALID at Pre-Folding; replacing primitive with inspectAccess()
