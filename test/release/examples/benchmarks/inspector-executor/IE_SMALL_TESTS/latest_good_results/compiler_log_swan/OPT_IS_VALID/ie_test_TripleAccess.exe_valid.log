+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Considering candidate irregular access at ie_test_TripleAccess.chpl:44 (forall at ie_test_TripleAccess.chpl:43)
	- Parent: B, Call: C
		- index iterator C is defined outside of the loop
		- Candidate is valid thus far
+ [IRREG WRITE AGGR] Considering candidate irregular access at ie_test_TripleAccess.chpl:44 (forall at ie_test_TripleAccess.chpl:43)
	- Parent: B, Call: C
		 !!! irregular access is not on LHS of operation

+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Pre-Folding Analyzing candidate at ie_test_TripleAccess.chpl:43: parent -> B, call -> C, access type -> INSPECTOR
	- B and C are arrays
	- B supports the localSubdomain() query
	- forall is iterating over a distributed domain/array
	- index iterator C is an array or domain
	- loop iterator C is an array or domain
	- B's element type is POD
	- forall is nested in an outer serial loop
	- $$$ Optimization VALID at Pre-Folding; replacing primitive with inspectAccess()
