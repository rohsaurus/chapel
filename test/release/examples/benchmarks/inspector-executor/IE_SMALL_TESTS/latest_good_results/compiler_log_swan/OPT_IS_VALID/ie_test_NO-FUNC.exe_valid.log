+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Considering candidate irregular access at ie_test_NO-FUNC.chpl:36 (forall at ie_test_NO-FUNC.chpl:35)
	- Parent: A, Call: B
		- index iterator B is defined outside of the loop
		- Candidate is valid thus far
+ [IRREG WRITE AGGR] Considering candidate irregular access at ie_test_NO-FUNC.chpl:36 (forall at ie_test_NO-FUNC.chpl:35)
	- Parent: A, Call: B
		 !!! irregular access is not on LHS of operation

+ [INSPECTOR-EXECUTOR] Pre-Folding Analyzing candidate at ie_test_NO-FUNC.chpl:35: parent -> A, call -> B, access type -> INSPECTOR
	- A and B are arrays
	- A supports the localSubdomain() query
	- forall is iterating over a distributed domain/array
	- index iterator B is an array or domain
	- loop iterator B is an array or domain
	- A's element type is POD
	- forall is nested in an outer serial loop
	- $$$ Optimization VALID at Pre-Folding; replacing primitive with inspectAccess()
